  <p>REWIND DESING</p>
   <br>
   <br>
  This is a project that I started on 7 January 2018. That will allow people to sell code to each
  other that will help them to give their site a better design with amazing animation layouts.
   <br>
   <br>
  I just finished some designs for the front page of the website, which you can have a look at bellow.
   <br>
   <br>
  This will be a long-term project that will take a couple of months. As I am learning and building at the same time.
